## Best Practices
 * Minimize the use of location based policies
 * Most companies do not have compliance around MacOS or Linux, In the event you do not, focus those policies on Windows.  Something is better than nothing.
 * Group based policies are great for one off requirements. Most holes exist because groups are poorly maintain and do not include all the accounts. Base policies should be focus'd on all users.
 * 

## Persona's
 * **All Users** = All Users
 * **Internal Users** = All Users Exclude Guest
 * **Privileged Role Members** = Directory Roles (Application Administrator,Authentication Administrator,Cloud Application Administrator,Conditional Access Administrator,Exchange Administrator,Global Administrator,Helpdesk Administrator,Hybrid Identity Administrator,Password Administrator,Privileged Authentication Administrator,Privileged Role Administrator,Security Administrator,SharePoint Administrator,User Administrator)
 * **Directory Sync Account** = Directory Role (Directory Sync Account)
 * **Break Glass Account** = Emergency Account that needs to be excluded from all policies
 * **Accounts Excluded** = Usually Service accounts or vault accounts that present an issue because MFA cannot be used.
 * **Azure Subscription Owners** = These are actual owners of Azure Subscriptions.

## Apps
* If not specified All Cloud Apps is required for the conditional access policies.

## Base Protection
### Require internal users to use trusted or compliant device for register security information

| Users | Cloud Apps or Actions | Conditions | Grant | Session |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Include: All users  <br /> Exclude: BreakGlass  | User actions: register security information |  | Require Hybrid Azure AD joined device,   <br /> Require device to be marked as compliant,  <br /> Require one of the selected controls  | |  

 **Prereq:** NA

 **Comment:** This conditional access policy will require a user to be on a compliant device in order for them to be able to register MFA settings.  This could easily be swapped to require trusted location.  More than likely this will require an exclusion to make sure new users have a way to set up mfa for the first time. Only apply this to operating systems that are actually sending compliant status to Intune / Azure AD

### Block accounts excluded from require MFA policies from non trusted location

| Users | Cloud Apps or Actions | Conditions | Grant | Session |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Include: (Group of excluded users) <br /> Exclude: BreakGlass  | Include: All Cloud Apps  | Include: All Networks  <br /> Exclude: Trusted Networks | Block |  |

**Prereq:** Trusted Locations (IP Ranges) should be defined.  

**Comment:** This Conditional Access Policy is used to make sure accounts excluded from requiring MFA should be required to authenticate from trusted locations. Link below contains the script that can be used to scan all the conditional access policy exclusions and return a list of accounts that should be in this list.  Do not include the breakglass account.

## Notes
### How to run a Log Analytics Query
* In the Azure AD Portal
* Navigate to the Log Analytics Tab
* Copy the example code from the section you want to review the possible impact
* Replace the existing text in the query window or open a new query tab and paste in the new one.
* Then select Run and wait for the results.  

![Untitled](./media/law.jpg)   

**Or Deploy the query pack that contains all the queries from this solution into the Log Analytics Workspace that contains the Azure AD Audit / Signin logs**

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fchadmcox%2FAzure_AD_Conditional_Access_Policies%2Fmain%2Fconditionalaccesspolicyimpactquerypack.json)

* After the query pack is deployed
* In the Azure AD Portal
* Navigate to the Log Analytics Tab
* Select the Queries and change the group by to Label

### Create list of privileged users for the kql designed to search for privileged user impact  

* Run this in PowerShell
```
Connect-MgGraph
Select-MgProfile -Name beta
$roles = @("Application Administrator","Authentication Administrator","Cloud Application Administrator","Conditional Access Administrator","Exchange Administrator","Global Administrator","Helpdesk Administrator","Hybrid Identity Administrator","Password Administrator","Privileged Authentication Administrator","Privileged Role Administrator","Security Administrator","SharePoint Administrator","User Administrator")
(Get-MgDirectoryRole -ExpandProperty members -all | where {$_.displayname -In $roles} | select -ExpandProperty members).id  -join('","') | out-file .\privuser.txt
```
* The results of this will be in a file called privuser.txt
* Open the txt file.  Should look something like this
```
8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b
```
* Next in the sections titled **Log Analytics AAD SigninLogs Query (KQL) needs results from the PowerShell script** from the section you are reviewing.  Will want to copy the kql statement, and paste in Log Analytics.
* on line 1 replace the phrase **replace this with the results from the privuser.txt found from the powershell cmdlets** 
```
let privusers = pack_array("**replace this with the results from the privuser.txt found from the powershell cmdlets**");
```
* to look like
```
let privusers = pack_array("8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b","8f47d5a6-a36b-4d99-b6bc-c023cf23ae9b");

### Find IPAddress not defined as trusted
**Log Analytics AAD SigninLogs Query (KQL)**
```
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ResultType == "0"
| where HomeTenantId == ResourceTenantId
| where NetworkLocationDetails !contains "trustedNamedLocation"
| extend TrustedLocation = tostring(iff(NetworkLocationDetails contains 'trustedNamedLocation', 'trustedNamedLocation',''))
| extend isIPv6 = tostring(iff(IPAddress matches regex @"(([\d|\w]{1,4}\:){7}[\d|\w]{1,4})",'Yes','No'))
| distinct IPAddress, TrustedLocation, UserPrincipalName, isIPv6
| summarize uniqueusercountbyip = count() by IPAddress, TrustedLocation, isIPv6
| where uniqueusercountbyip >= 4
| sort by uniqueusercountbyip desc 
```

**Comment**  

This query returns IP addresses where 4 or more unique users have authenticated against Azure AD.  You will want to research each IP and determine if they are owned by the organization or if they belong to something like a public proxy cloud solution like zscaler or umbrella.  Legit ones will need to be defined as a trusted network in Azure AD to make sure any location filtered policy works correctly and to help remediate false positives in Azure Identity Protection

Instructions on how to create named locations can be viewed here [Named locations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition#named-locations)   

The field uniqueusercountbyip is count of unique list of users. It is possible to see ipv6 addresses which usually comes from Azure Networks and will be normal in the near future from the internet.

### Applications not being protected by Conditional Access Policies
**Log Analytics AAD SigninLogs Query (KQL)**
```
//https://github.com/reprise99/Sentinel-Queries/blob/main/Azure%20Active%20Directory/Identity-Top20AppswithnoCA.kql
//This query shows applications that are not protected by conditional access policies.
let apps=
    SigninLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago (30d)
    | project TimeGenerated, ConditionalAccessPolicies, AppDisplayName
//Exclude native Microsoft apps that you can't enforce policy on or that are covered natively in Office 365
    | where AppDisplayName !in ("Microsoft Office Web Apps Service", "Microsoft App Access Panel", "Office Online Core SSO", "Microsoft Authentication Broker", "Microsoft Account Controls V2", "Microsoft 365 Support Service","Office Online Maker SSO","My Apps","My Profile")
    | mv-expand ConditionalAccessPolicies
    | extend CAResult = tostring(ConditionalAccessPolicies.result)
    | summarize ResultSet=make_set(CAResult) by AppDisplayName
    | where ResultSet !has "success" or ResultSet !has "failure"
    | project AppDisplayName;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ResultType == 0
| where AppDisplayName in (apps)
| summarize Count=count()by AppDisplayName
| top 20 by Count

```

**Comment**  
The image below, shows the applications and the logon count of those apps that is not being protected by some sort of Conditional Access Policy. Ideally every application will have a mfa requirement or a trusted/compliant policy requirement.
